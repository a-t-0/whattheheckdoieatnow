You&#8217;re not alone! And if you&#8217;re holding back on traveling and experiencing life because feeding your kids is literally a pain in the ass,  I hope I can first offer you an abundance of empathy and second, help encourage you  to reconsider..</p>
<p>Last month, in a silent, cranky, rebellious protest of the colder months coming,  I decided to irresponsibly parent my children by taking them out of school and flying off with them and my mom in search of warmer weather, adventure and good vegan food.</p>
<p>Until now, traveling with my kiddos has consisted of one destination holidays and pre-booked accommodation that always includes the mandatory full kitchen. Because of a few bad experiences, eating out on the fly with my kids has just always been less than appealing (and wasteful) and cooking at home has always been the easier alternative. We seldom take the kids out to eat in local restaurants so finding restaurants in unfamiliar territory with not only &#8216;vegan options&#8217; but &#8216;kid approved vegan options&#8217; can feel challenging.</p>
<p>Kids are fussy for at least a million different reasons and although we <em>all</em>  have those friends with kids that eat absolutely everything (and I enviously commend them for a job well done), I also recognize that at times there are food and eating issues beyond the parent&#8217;s control. Some kids just can’t handle strange and unappealing textures and flavors and despite repeated attempts to familiarize them with these new foods …It doesn&#8217;t always go well. If it goes down it, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s not staying there.. and that’s not fun for anyone. For the parents of these kids…we need to dig deep into our often already depleted patience stores and remember that with time and perseverance we <em>will</em> see improvements in the variety of foods they are able to tolerate. But until then&#8230;what do we do?</p>
<p>We do our best and usually it&#8217;s frigging exhausting.</p>
<p>In the past, this has definitely kept our family from planning lengthier holidays and it has predictably greatly influenced our choice of destinations.</p>
<p>My own personal love of traveling began when I was 17 after a friend of mine and I began talking late one night about life and the world and all it&#8217;s wonders and all of the places we&#8217;d love to visit. Before we we knew it, this late night conversation had become an actual plan. We were going to see the world! It wasn&#8217;t overly thought out on our part and when we arrived at our fifth destination (Australia) I had less than $50 in my pocket and no idea where I&#8217;d be staying. I ended up staying 6 months longer so obviously things worked out but this first trip planted the lifelong travel bug that would lead me to many more destinations over the years, create incredible lifelong friendships, crazy experiences and irreplaceable memories. I learned surprisingly, that the world was nothing like the way it was  portrayed in my high school textbooks and that many conflicts, world events and international news stories are often presented through a very distorted and often over simplified, one sided perspective. Although I was not yet vegan, traveling allowed me to witness multiple perspectives and opened my eyes to the life experiences of others, in a way that nothing else had and ultimately lead me to where I am now. Books are great but I also want <em>this</em> &#8216;see it for yourself&#8217; real life education for my kids. The travel of my youth is still the eventual goal for my kids&#8230;backpacks and youth hostels, foreign languages, unusual food, spontaneity, buses and trains. I want to plant that seed and we have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>So as mentioned, when I decided to book this &#8216;beginners&#8217; 15 night holiday in multiple locations in California, I planned on taking baby steps. We would test the waters by booking comfortable accommodation <em>with</em> kitchens because that just seemed easier than trying to wing it.</p>
<p>First up was San Diego and since we wanted to be right on the beach/boardwalk, surprisingly to me, the accommodation I needed (the mandatory kitchen) just full on didn&#8217;t exist. As in there were none, anywhere. I decided to book it anyway thinking that I would have better luck next location.</p>
<p>Anaheim is obviously geared towards children and families so finding a kitchen was as predicted, not a problem.</p>
<p>Our final 5 days would be in Palm Springs and again it was surprisingly difficult to find both the desired location and amenities so I made my choice. F*ck it, we would make this work and choose location.</p>
<p>I booked, paid and then I have to admit somewhat embarrassingly,  I kind of panicked. What the hell had I done? In my mind, it was quite seriously a possibility that in these 15 days my youngest and most difficult to feed child could literally starve to death. What was I thinking?</p>
<p>I tried to reassure myself that &#8216;simple, widely available and liked- by- him  grocery store items like peanut butter,  bread, hummus, fruit and nuts could and would sustain him&#8217;. When that didn&#8217;t work,  I called my mom who repeatedly reassured me that &#8216;simple, widely available and liked- by- him  grocery store items like peanut butter, bread, hummus, fruit and nuts could and would sustain him&#8217;.</p>
<p>Our plan was pretty simple. We would buy the basics. We would eat breakfast in the hotel, pack lunches and cross our fingers that dinners would just sort of work out (with a bit of planning). We would have fun!</p>
<p>After loosely constructing a &#8216;things we wanted to see and do&#8217; itinerary, I used the &#8216;Happy Cow&#8217; app (seriously, you <em>need</em> this in your life) to find a few vegan friendly restaurants in each area. I briefly glanced over their menus to ensure that they fit the criteria (sometimes I don&#8217;t even know what that is) and  if they passed, I made a small side note on our itinerary. This was such a time saver and repeatedly saved us from walking aimlessly in circles with hungry kids in tow (an almost guaranteed way to ruin an otherwise good day!)<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6378" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4844-3.jpg?resize=960%2C1053" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4844-3.jpg?w=960 960w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4844-3.jpg?resize=274%2C300 274w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4844-3.jpg?resize=768%2C842 768w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4844-3.jpg?resize=934%2C1024 934w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Before we left, I filled each of our carry on bags with one large ziplock bag full of snacks.  I baked and packed a full zucchini walnut  loaf (Call me crazy but yes, I did), peanuts,  sandwiches, granola bars, dried fruit, popcorn, hummus, and crackers. If we arrived at our destination and didn&#8217;t want to rush out to go grocery shopping (as well as having to find somewhere for dinner), we wouldn&#8217;t have to. As silly as this sounded to my husband, this was a lifesaver because as predicted we didn&#8217;t find a grocery store upon arrival and that zucchini loaf made a damn tasty breakfast:)<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6305" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4866-1.jpg?resize=1100%2C825" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4866-1.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4866-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4866-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4866-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />We arrived at our hotel, ventured out onto the Boardwalk and briefly hopped over a few blocks to check out Soulshine café. We were starving. I was a little anxious about our first California dining experience but holy smokes.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6306" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4868-1.jpg?resize=1100%2C825" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4868-1.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4868-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4868-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_4868-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6302" src="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_8781.jpg?resize=825%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_8781.jpg?w=825 825w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_8781.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_8781.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Not only did my little one eat, he liked it!! Figuring that if we ordered a little of everything, the law of averages would absolutely ensure that there would be at least one thing he liked, was a good call. Ok seriously, it was an excuse because my mom and I LOVE to eat. We ordered mac n&#8217; cheese, sushi, a quinoa salad and knock your socks off delicious tacos.  The tofu, avocado, carrot, cucumber sushi rolls were a hit. So was the quinoa salad (What? They&#8217;ve both always hated quinoa..). Day 1 was done and my difficult to feed kid was not only still alive but even well nourished (beans, greens, veggie, complex carbs&#8230;check!)<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6382" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5012-1.jpg?resize=1100%2C825" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5012-1.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5012-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5012-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5012-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Thai food downtown San Diego after a long but fun filled day touring the harbor and all it&#8217;s sunbathing mammals, exploring the USS Midway and wandering around Seaport Village. We ordered some sticky rice on the side for them and they were able to pick out enough from the communal dishes to fill their bellies. My son is getting annoyed with the volume of food Grandma <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> kept ordering..<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6376" src="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5405-1.jpg?resize=1100%2C825" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5405-1.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5405-1.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5405-1.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5405-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />We are a tired, hungry lot after spending the day hiking around Torrey Pines, climbing giant rock formations, exploring the beach and wandering around the spectacular scenery in La Jolla. Sushi Nekosan served us  the most beautiful, creative, artistic, flavourful sushi we&#8217;ve ever had but it hadn&#8217;t arrived yet when we took this photo! Boo! My boys missed out and ordered avocado rolls but hey, we were all full and happy:)<img class="alignnone wp-image-6318" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_8811.jpg?resize=825%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_8811.jpg?w=825 825w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_8811.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_8811.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" data-recalc-dims="1" />San Diego was easy. We banked on and found without difficulty sushi, Thai food, Pizza, burgers and ice cream (Thank you Ben and Jerry&#8217;s for always having vegan options).<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6319" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9097.jpg?resize=825%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9097.jpg?w=825 825w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9097.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9097.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> We packed and ate a LOT of peanut butter sandwiches:)<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6320" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9109.jpg?resize=1467%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9109.jpg?w=1467 1467w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9109.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9109.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9109.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> And had a lot of fun. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6311" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9119.jpg?resize=825%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9119.jpg?w=825 825w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9119.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9119.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" data-recalc-dims="1" />So many great memories:)<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6396" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9567.jpg?resize=2400%2C3600" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9567.jpg?w=2400 2400w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9567.jpg?resize=200%2C300 200w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9567.jpg?resize=768%2C1152 768w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9567.jpg?resize=683%2C1024 683w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9567.jpg?w=2000 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Despite this spectacular, fun-filled photo, Anaheim was not our favourite. I texted this photo to my husband while we were away and he responded with,  &#8216;I thought this trip was for the kids?&#8217;..Umm..It was..They look like they were having fun, don&#8217;t they;)</p>
<p>Although I suspected we weren&#8217;t really a &#8216;Disney family&#8217;, I wanted my kids to experience it once and decide for themselves. We planned  for one day per park and despite my kids schoolmates&#8217; insistence that that was <em>not</em> enough time, it really was. We had free tickets for a third day and actually chose not to go.</p>
<p>In Anaheim we finally had our kitchen (by the way, what is with hotels offering a <em>full</em> kitchen and then having 2 burners and <em>no</em> oven? Grrrr) and there was a very vegan friendly Target (groceries) within walking distance of our hotel. Complimentary buffet style breakfasts were free every morning and we were able to fill up on bagels, hash browns and fresh fruit. As planned, we cooked most of our meals at the hotel. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6312" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9955.jpg?resize=825%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9955.jpg?w=825 825w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9955.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9955.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Leaving Anaheim was not nearly as difficult as leaving San Diego had been and our arrival in Palm Springs was welcomed by all of us. No more crazy congested traffic, fewer people, it was much more laid back and the scenery was stunning. We were happy to pack lunches and spend the days exploring.

<p>Sometimes you have to be creative. My fussy child likes tofu so sometimes we had to pick the tofu out of our dishes to fill his little belly. He absolutely loves waffles and we were &#8216;forced&#8217; to order vegan chicken and waffles just to get the waffles. At Crossroads cafe you could order an avocado (from the &#8216;sides&#8217; menu), a cup of fruit and with an order of fries and with the bun from my burger (as seen above)&#8230;It worked.</p>
<p>We only had one restaurant experience that didn&#8217;t work and it was at a good ole Mexican restaurant in San Diego that even had Daiya cheese?! WTH, child!  The corn tortillas and black beans were not going down. What did we do? He ate the avocado and I had healthy snacks in my backpack. It was fine and it was literally once out of 15 days. I&#8217;d say not bad for how things could have gone.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6313" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9970.jpg?resize=1467%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9970.jpg?w=1467 1467w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9970.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9970.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_9970.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6323" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0399.jpg?resize=1467%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0399.jpg?w=1467 1467w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0399.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0399.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0399.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6345" src="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0423.jpg?resize=1100%2C1467" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0423.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0423.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0423.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />This was our Disneyland.

Fabulous.</p>
<p>I empathize with all the fussy kids because I too was that fussy child growing up and I didn&#8217;t expand my food horizons until I started traveling. My first time in Thailand with a friend was when I was about 19 years old and despite spending 5 weeks on a beautiful beach where the food was abundant and flavourful,  I ordered fried rice.. every day.. 3 times a day.. for breakfast.. lunch.. and dinner because..well..I didn&#8217;t like anything else. Well look at me now!</p>
<p>So yes, we had a &#8216;comfortable&#8217; holiday in nice hotels as opposed to hostels in an extremely vegan friendly state. We ate well. We purposely avoided having a car until it was necessary in Palm Springs. We met interesting immigrant Uber drivers whose political leanings repeatedly shocked me. We sweat and hiked and walked and explored and experienced the grittier areas at night because that was all part of the experience. My youngest surprised me and kept up. He ate. We survived and we got to do it all with grandma. They say the best things in life aren&#8217;t things. I&#8217;d have to agree.</p>
<p>Seek adventure, escape the ordinary..WITH your kids. Be brave and just do it!</p>
<p>Next up? We&#8217;re thinking Costa Rica but&#8230;isn&#8217;t that the land of corn tortillas and black beans??? Sounds kind of like this trip&#8217;s <em>one</em> meal gone wrong..</p>
<p>Oh well, we&#8217;ll figure it out. I&#8217;m ready! Bring it on!</p>

If you aren&#8217;t familiar with split yellow lentils (otherwise known as split yellow mung beans), you&#8217;re missing out on a nutritious, delicious, creamy and satiating ingredient that&#8217;s perfect for soups and stews. Because we have a large Indian population where I live, these are relatively easy to find in almost any local grocery store. If you&#8217;re having trouble finding them, try checking out your local Asian grocer or consider buying them online <a href="https://amzn.to/2O3yq6W">here</a>.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6146" src="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5733.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5733.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5733.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5733.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5733.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5733.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5733.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Heat the oil over medium heat and add your yellow onion. Cook for about 3- 4 minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add your pressed garlic and ground turmeric and stir well to combine. Add your toor dahl (split yellow lentils) and again stir well to combine. Add your 5 cups of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling reduce to a gentle simmer, cover and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring every few minutes to prevent sticking.</p>
<p>Add your salt, curry powder, cumin and ground mustard and stir to combine. Add your cauliflower florets. Cook for another 10 minutes until cauliflower florets are tender.</p>
<p>Add your chopped spinach, stir, and remove from heat.<br />

Of course I&#8217;m a bit reluctant to say good bye to summer but it WAS fabulous and well..it&#8217;s time:)</p>
<p>I have been asked many times this summer, what we pack in the kiddos lunch boxes for school. My kids are not huge fans of sandwiches and of course their favourite, peanut butter and jam, is not allowed in schools, so we have to be creative. We use bento style lunch boxes (<a href="https://amzn.to/2LVbjpf">Planet Box</a>) and absolutely love them. This kind of mimics the lunches I serve them at home and my kids seem to do better with small portions of lots of things. If I am not packing a sandwich, the largest portion of their lunch boxes is usually filled with a healthier home made muffin or loaf (I make a batch and freeze them), or hummus (or other bean dip) with crackers/ chips. The remaining sections of their bento boxes are filled with a variety of fresh and dried fruits (melons, berries, raisins, banana chips), veggies (carrots, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers), smoked tofu, dried chickpeas, sunflower/ pumpkin seeds, granola, seaweed&#8230;and whatever else is hanging around.</p>
<p>This Zucchini, Carrot, Walnut Loaf is a huge hit and yeah it&#8217;s got some sugar, but it&#8217;s also full of some pretty healthy stuff.</p>

Yellow Ataulfo mangoes from the Philippines or red Tommy Atkins?</p>
<p>I don’t know about you but when I see fresh, ripe, juicy mangoes in store I tend to gravitate towards the yellow Ataulfo mangoes (from the Philippines) because they are reliably juicier and sweeter (in my opinion) than the larger (and also undeniably delicious) red Tommy Atkins variety. Regardless of choice make sure the  mangoes you buy are ripe in that they yield to a bit of pressure when giving a gentle squeeze or else biting into one will cause you to pucker.. and your recipe won’t come out quite the way you&#8217;d planned.</p>
<p>Mangoes are definitely a favourite around here and when they are not in season we prefer to buy them frozen when they are picked and packaged when sweet and ripe as opposed to &#8216;ripening&#8217; while in store. We use them in chutney, ice cream, salad, wraps, smoothies and in this sweet, salty, spicy, sour, savoury, and delicious side salad!! (I only recommend using fresh mangoes for this recipe:)</p>
<p>This flavourful side salad only takes a few minutes to whip up. If you&#8217;re not eating it right away, wait and add the cashews shortly before serving to preserve their crunch.</p>
<p>Make your dressing in a separate small bowl by mixing the lime juice, agave, sambal olek and salt. Add your diced mangoes, finely chopped mint and cashews to a larger bowl. Add the dressing over top and mix well to combine.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6155" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5798.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5798.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5798.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5798.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5798.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5798.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_5798.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Serve at room temperature or chilled.

Although they have a large selection of vegan options (making eating out rather easy), I still can&#8217;t order anything but their Bangkok Wrap with Evil Peanut Sauce because well if you&#8217;ve had it, it&#8217;s just so, so good!! Ordering anything else could undoubtedly only disappoint (I did try <em>once</em>..and was&#8230;well..predictably disappointing).</p>
<p>Their standard wrap comes with non vegan crunchy noodles which I always sub out for chickpeas and then add quinoa.

Spring has finally arrived and THIS delicious, fresh Spring Pasta Salad is my new favourite thing! With fresh asparagus, crispy snap peas, cherry tomatoes and a delicious savoury basil dressing you&#8217;ll make this again and again:)</p>
<p>Chop all your ingredients. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. One minute before the pasta is done add your snap peas and chopped asparagus. Drain and immediately rinse under cold water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile make your dressing by whisking together the olive oil, mayonnaise, vinegar, salt and mustard. Add your shallots and basil and stir to combine. Add pepper to taste.</p>
<p>In a large bowl add your drained pasta, peas and asparagus. Add your chopped yellow pepper. cherry tomatoes and green onions. Toss gently with the dressing. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6060" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MG_5594.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MG_5594.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MG_5594.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MG_5594.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MG_5594.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MG_5594.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MG_5594.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Allow it to sit for at least 1/2 hour to blend the flavours. If refrigerating, remove it from the fridge 20 minutes before serving.</p>
<p>Want to make this salad for a potluck? Make it the night before omitting the tomatoes until the following day. Allow the salad to come to room temperature and add an extra drizzle of olive oil if necessary.</p>
<p>Gluten free or cooking for someone who is? Just use your favourite gluten free pasta.</p>

For God&#8217;s sake&#8230;Enough with this wet, dreary weather, right?!!</p>
<p>We finally got away this winter, kids and all, on a much too short two week vacation in search of sun and warmth..to Hawaii&#8230;I remember asking some friends last year if booking this trip to a warm destination near the END of February was kind of silly. I mean after all, it would almost be March and March is supposed to be warmer, brighter, better right? Why would I waste our hard earned vacation money if the weather was already improving here.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that was a dumb thought. Now it&#8217;s April and not only is it STILL grey and dreary and raining and raining and raining some more&#8230;now I have the frickin&#8217; sniffles. Yes, 2 or 3 days after symbolically returning the Vitamin C and Zinc tabs back up to the highest cupboard (they won&#8217;t be needed until next year right?) and I wake up with a sore throat. Which means..someone&#8217;s making me soup (Ok..Let&#8217;s get real. No one&#8217;s making me soup except well..me).</p>
<p>And yes, I realize that if these are my biggest problems, life is actually pretty good:)</p>
<p>So here it is. Delicious, satisfying soup for the sniffles (the literal and whingy sniffles;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not usually a huge fan of tomato based anything but I was inspired by a very omnivorous, slow cooker recipe that I happened to peruse in our local paper. Here&#8217;s my veganized, flavorful, easy to make<a href="https://amzn.to/2qlIPNu"> Instant Pot </a>version. It&#8217;s delicious! Enjoy!<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6034" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Set up your <a href="https://amzn.to/2qlIPNu">Instant Pot</a> and with the lid off, hit the saute button. Once hot add your oil (optional) and allow it to heat. Saute your onions and fennel for about 2 minutes, stirring a couple of times. Add your pressed garlic, cumin and coriander and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add your chopped carrots, sweet potato and dried red lentils. Stir well to combine. Add your crushed tomatoes and vegetable broth and stir well. Put the lid on your Instant Pot, lock into place and using the &#8216;Soup&#8217; button set it for 6 minutes.</p>
<p>Once done allow it to naturally release pressure for about 10 minutes and then vent it to release any remaining steam. Once the pressure is fully released, turn off the instant pot and remove the lid.</p>
<p>Add 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 2 tbsp of brown sugar (this is necessary to decrease the acidity of the tomatoes), and the 1/2 cup chopped parsley. Stir well to combine.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6036" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup3.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup3.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup3.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup3.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup3.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup3.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hearty-Red-Lentil-and-Sweet-Potato-Instant-Pot-Soup3.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Let this soup sit for a couple of hours to allow the flavors to blend. Refrigerate until later or reheat to serve. Serve with a crusty roll and a side salad. It is well worth the wait:)</p>

I don&#8217;t recall this being a staple in my childhood but in my teen years? Yep..it was a comfort food favourite.</p>
<p>Recently I saw a flurry of posts with vegans everywhere posting photos of their version of this &#8216;classic&#8217; dish and thought what the heck, I&#8217;d throw my hat in the ring too. I didn&#8217;t want a plant based crumble and cheese version (like most seemed to be) so I set out to make something a little less processed and a whole lot tasty;) After making and revising many times, I finally perfected the texture of the tofu and the flavour and consistency of the sauce and here it is! Meaty, chewy tofu in a thick, savoury sauce.</p>
<p>This recipe makes a fair bit but that was planned as this makes the BEST leftovers..<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5995" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper2.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper2.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper2.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper2.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper2.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper2.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper2.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />To make the tofu &#8216;hamburger&#8217;: Drain the tofu well. Press with a <a href="http://amzn.to/2H1KzlA">tofu press</a> for 10-15 minutes if you&#8217;d like to decrease the cooking time (optional). Preheat your oven to 400 F (200 C). Crumble your tofu into very small crumbles by hand or use a <a href="http://amzn.to/2BOextX">food processor </a>and pulse (don&#8217;t puree it!). Mix the soy sauce, cumin, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder and oil in a medium sized bowl. Add the tofu and toss until evenly combined.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5997" src="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper3.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper3.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper3.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper3.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper3.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper3.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper3.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Place parchment paper on a baking tray and evenly spread the seasoned tofu crumbles onto it. Cook for 20 minutes and flip the crumbles around, evenly redistributing them over the tray and return them to the oven once again. Cook for another 20 minutes, remove, stir and return the crumbles to the oven for a final 10-15 minutes watching them closely. Your goal is to have the crumbles dry into a meat like chewy texture, allowing for some crispiness (but don&#8217;t let them burn!)<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5999" src="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper4.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper4.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper4.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper4.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper4.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper4.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Vegan-Hamburger-Helper4.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Once the desired colour and texture has been reached, remove from the oven and set aside.<br />
For the Pasta: Heat a large <a href="http://amzn.to/2si6yl3">Dutch Oven</a> over medium heat. Add your 1 tbsp of oil and saute the onion for about 4 minutes. Add your pressed garlic and saute another minute. Add your oregano, paprika, parsley, garlic powder, salt, pinch of cayenne, nutritional yeast, water, milk, vegetable broth and tomato sauce and stir well to combine. Bring it to a boil. Once boiling add your penne, reduce heat slightly to maintain a gentle boil, and cook according to package directions remembering to stir often to prevent sticking. Don&#8217;t worry if your pot looks like it has too much liquid in it. It doesn&#8217;t!<br />

Preheat your oven to 325 F (160 C). Press the tofu using a tofu press (I use <a href="http://amzn.to/2B9j7Py">this one</a>) or by placing something heavy on top wrapped in a towel for about 15 minutes.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5917" src="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5334.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5334.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5334.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5334.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5334.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5334.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5334.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Cut the tofu into 1/2 inch squares and place into a bowl. Add the 2 tbsp of soy sauce and toss to coat evenly.<img class="alignnone wp-image-5918" src="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5348.jpg?resize=1100%2C1100" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5348.jpg?w=1100 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5348.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5348.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5348.jpg?resize=768%2C768 768w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5348.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/whattheheckdoieatnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/MG_5348.jpg?resize=100%2C100 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" />Spread onto a pan and cook for about 40 minutes turning once at the halfway mark. Remove from the oven and set aside.</p>
<p>For the cauliflower: Turn your oven up to 450 F (230 C). Lightly oil a pan and spread out your cauliflower florets evenly. Bake for about 15 minutes until cauliflower edges begin to brown. Remove from the oven.</p>
<p>For the Sauce: Add the soy sauce, maple syrup, rice vinegar, pressed garlic, sesame oil, grated ginger and water to a saucepan. Heat to boiling while frequently whisking. Meanwhile mix your cornstarch and 3 tbsp cold water in a small dish. When your sauce comes to a boil, add your cornstarch mix and reduce heat to medium until sauce has thickened. Remove from heat.</p>
<p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add your cashews. Toast while stirring frequently for about 2-3 minutes until they start to lightly brown. Add your sauce, cauliflower and baked tofu to the skillet with the cashews. Add your peas and stir to combine.<br />
