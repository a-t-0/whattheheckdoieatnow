## How to help
First, a list with shortcuts in format:
```
[receipe name](relative link to the webpage)
```
would be of great convenience. A start:

[Creamy Cauliflower Curry Soup](2021/03/09/test/index.html)


I think it should be restored before it can be hosted again. (I assume this is just a collection of the raw receipe pages of the website, without any structure).

If someone could host it again that would be wonderfull. If it is restored I can host it on a `.tor` domain.
