		<description><![CDATA[Whoever would have thought that tahini in cookies could be so good!!  This has become our favorite cookie treat.  I have to stay gluten free so just subbed oat flour for the wheat and spelt.  Used mostly coconut sugar and threw in some shredded coconut just because I love it in everything.  The molasses adds a special something to the flavor so don&#039;t leave it out.    They also hold together better than any other eggless  cookies I&#039;ve made.  You have another winner here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha! You post cracked me up!! We were alway camping and although I could read your post I wasn&#039;t able to log in to reply. With your &quot;h-e-double hockey sticks&quot; I can&#039;t help but think you may be a fellow Canadian;) I&#039;m glad you liked the cookies. We just plowed through 10 dozen ourselves! Superb hiking fuel...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, my second batch within a week are in the oven now. These cookies are truly delicious. I subbed coconut palm sugar for white and used half and half AP flour and whole wheat. I will definitely be making them again, and again and again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I came across your site as a result of a subscription to greatest.com and started browsing. Found this recipe and knew I had some tahini in the cupboard that&#039;s just been sitting there because I found it too bitter (a Greek organic brand). I thought, what the h-e-double hockey sticks, I&#039;ll try this recipe to use it up, keeping fingers crossed that I&#039;d like the result, but I was skeptical. Well, slap my butt and call me Mary - DELICIOUS COOKIES!! I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and one cup AP, didn&#039;t have molasses so used maple syrup instead and used coconut sugar. Wow - shockingly good cookies! I&#039;ve bookmarked the recipe (as well as a few others) and will subscribe to your blog. I thank you, my empty jar of tahini thanks you, and although somewhat healthier cookies, the jury&#039;s still out on whether or not my hips will thank you.]]></description>
