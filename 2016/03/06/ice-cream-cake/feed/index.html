		<description><![CDATA[Coconut Bliss ice cream is widely available throughout Canada and the US. I did a quick search on their page for locations near you in Texas. It looks like it is available at Safeway. Here&#039;s their webpage. You can punch your zip code in to find the nearest location to you. http://coconutbliss.com/map/. Coconut whip cream is also widely available in most grocery stores. It comes premade in a can under pressure, similar to premade dairy whipped cream and is probably found in the same area of the store. If you want to make your own there are many similar recipes online. Here&#039;s a link to one: http://minimalistbaker.com/how-to-make-coconut-whipped-cream/. Hope that helps!]]></description>
