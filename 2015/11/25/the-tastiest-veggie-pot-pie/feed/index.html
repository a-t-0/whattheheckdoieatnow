		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tara! Thank you for this recipe. I had been missing pot pie for ten years before a friend recommended this to me and we absolutely love it in our house.  However, we only have almond flour right now and I&#039;m assuming this wouldn&#039;t be a good substitute-would that be correct in your opinion? Stay well and thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would think so but honestly I haven&#039;t used a crockpot in years so I can&#039;t say for sure how different the finished product might be (minus crust of course). Let me know how it turns out!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi, 
This recipes looks the best from all the ones i&#039;ve looked at, but I&#039;m hoping to find a crockpot one, Do you think this would work in the crockpot. and just OMIT the pie crust (we don&#039;t have an oven at the moment) 

thanks]]></description>
