		<description><![CDATA[Noah, when I first stumbled across this recipe I had concerns about the beans as well. I use small white beans (I have removed the cannellini as an option:), completely pulverize them in a Vitamix and then cook them (not merely warm them up) in a waffle iron. They are completely cooked by the time we eat them:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[White kidney beans (cannellini) contain a toxin, Phytohaemagglutinin (Kidney Bean Lectin). You&#039;re supposed to boil them to destroy it. Merely heating them up can make the beans more toxic.

I personally would never eat cannellini beans that have not been boiled for at least 10 minutes.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had a couple of people ask me this. I haven&#039;t tried using canned beans so I&#039;m not sure but I am guessing they might be a bit mushy? Let me know if you try!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These turned out great. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Even my son ate them. I did find they turned out better on the waffle iron if I did not use any kind of oil on the iron itself, kinda weird but they cooked so much better.  I also used some of the batter to make pancakes and they turned out ok, not as good as the waffles  but good enough for me to eat :-)

I will definitely be checking out the other recipes too. Thanks!]]></description>
